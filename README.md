# Chess-Tournament-Management-System
## Introduction
As the chess captain of my high school, I created a project in Java to manage the records of chess playing students.
It is a very basic project, and I made it for the Internal Assessment component of the International Baccaluareate (IB)
Computer Science Higher Level subject.

## Specifics
The code is in tournament.java and IA.java files. IA.java is the main file that does all the work and is a sub-class of tournament.java.

## Functionalities
The user has following options
1. Create a new set of records
2. Add the record of a tournament to the existing set
3. Give the user the choice to use the functions below
4. Search the records for all tournaments between two dates
5. Search the records for a student's performance at a particular tournament
6. Search the records for a student's performance at a particular venue
7. Search the records for a student's performance at all tournaments
8. Search the records for all tournaments at a specific venue

Each object of the tournament class has the following features:
1. Name
2. Venue
3. Starting gate
